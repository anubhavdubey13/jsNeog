# Banana Translator

Banana is the language of Minions, a character you might be familiar with. If not, kindly Google. I am sure you would have seen them on somebody's tshirt.

In this project, the flow is as follows:<br>
1. User Inputs text they wish translated to Banana
2. On submission, a callback function uses an external api (funtranslations) to create the translation.
3. The translated text is then rendered on the browser using innerHTML in JS.

Access the translator here: [Banana Banana!](https://banana-banana--anubhavdubey13.repl.co/)<br>
PS: There is a limitation on API calls. Go easy.
